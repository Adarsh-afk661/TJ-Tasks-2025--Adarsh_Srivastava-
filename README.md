### 📚 DSA | Beginner / Easy Level Problems

This repository contains solutions to three fundamental **Data Structures & Algorithms** problems.  
Each problem focuses on logic building, mathematical reasoning, and efficient implementation in code.

## 🧮 Question 1: Minimum Operations to Make Product Positive  

### 🔍 Problem Overview  
You are given an array of integers. Your task is to determine the **minimum number of operations** required to make the **product of all elements positive**.

### 💡 Logic Used  
1. **Count Zeros and Negatives:**  
   - Traverse the array and count how many elements are `0` and how many are negative (`< 0`).  

2. **Handle Zero Elements:**  
   - Each `0` must be converted to `1` → each conversion counts as one operation.  

3. **Check Parity of Negatives:**  
   - If the number of negatives is even → product is already positive.  
   - If odd → flip one negative to positive (requires 1 extra operation).  

4. **Total Operations:**  
   ```
   total_ops = zeros + (negatives are odd ? 1 : 0)
   ```
   
5. **Print the Result** for each test case.

## 🔢 Question 2: Sum of Alternating Sequence  

### 🔍 Problem Overview  
For given integers `x` and `n`, you need to compute the **sum of an alternating sequence** according to given conditions.

### 💡 Logic Used  
1. Read number of test cases `t`.  
2. For each test case, take input values `x` and `n`.  
3. Apply logic:  
   - If `n` is even → the sum of the sequence = `0`.  
   - If `n` is odd → the sum = `x`.  
4. Print the result for every test case.

## 🌎 Question 3: Trippi Troppi’s World  

### 🔍 Problem Overview  
Given three words for each test case, form a **modern name** by using the initials.

### 💡 Logic Used  
1. Input total number of test cases `t`.  
2. For each test case, read three space-separated words.  
3. Take the **first character** from each word.  
4. Concatenate them to form the result (modern name).  
5. Print the final output.
