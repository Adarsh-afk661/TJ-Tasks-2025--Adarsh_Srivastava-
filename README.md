# ⚙️ Minimum Operations to Make Product Positive

## 🧩 Problem Statement

You are given an array `a` of `n` integers, where each element is **−1**, **0**, or **1**.  
In one operation, you can choose an index `i` and **increase** `a[i]` by 1.

That means:
- `-1 → 0 → 1 → 2 → ...`
- `0 → 1 → 2 → ...`

Your goal is to make the **product of all elements strictly positive** (`> 0`)  
using the **minimum number of operations**.

It is guaranteed that this is always possible.
